# Installation on Windows

## Setting up the camera
If you are using a PS3 eye camera, make sure you can make a VideoCapture(0) 
with your opencv. If you are not able to do that you probably need to do this:

Install CL-Eye driver (the version which we installed was not free and you have to pya $2.99 for it).
Install the manycam app.
